The main challenge I faced was redoing the project after failing to just use media queries. Luckily my design styling from my styles.css caried over nicely paired with my new strategy: using tailwind. One of the issues I had with tailwind were trying to keep that styles.css file and the tailwind code from overriding each other. I also had trouble with avoiding text moving out of boxes when screen sizes got too small. I found that centering the text and using break-words to wrap pieces of words under each other when the screen gets smaller helped with that. My charts are fully visible on the screen, but I really enjoy how they are designed to side scroll in one spot, so I ended up keeping that feature, since in my eyes it doesnt break the side scrolling rule because it is all on same horizontally static page. Lastly, I had the challenge of ChatGPT trying to compress my page to phone and tablet sizes from desktop view instead of adapting to smaller screen sizes actively.
